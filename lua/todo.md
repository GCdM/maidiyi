- [ ] Update telescope `<leader>sh` to open with FloatingHelp plugin
- [ ] Get rid of '[No name]' buffers
- [ ] Add Telescope search for TODO comments
- [ ] Unfix soft wrapping for markdown. Change it to text files, so markdown can still be formatted/linted
    - [ ] Currently relying on columns=80, which is a bad UX with changing window sizes. See if there is a better alternative.
